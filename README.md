|--------|-------|
| **CV RMSE Mean** | 0.11436 |
| **CV RMSE Std** | 0.00581 |
| **Train RMSE** | 0.0953 |
| **Validation RMSE** | 0.1211 |
| **Train/Valid Ratio** | 0.79 (Moderate overfitting) |
| **Kaggle Score** | *[Estimated: 0.11-0.13]* |

### Model Comparison

| Model | CV RMSE | Train RMSE | Valid RMSE | Status |
|-------|---------|------------|------------|--------|

### Top 5 Most Important Features (SHAP Analysis)

1. **TotalSF** (Total Square Footage) - ↑ Positive impact (r=0.833)
2. **OverallQual** (Overall Quality) - ↑ Positive impact (r=0.79)
3. **HouseAge** (Age of House) - ↓ Negative impact (r=-0.524)
4. **TotalBathrooms** (Total Bathrooms) - ↑ Positive impact (r=0.636)
5. **GrLivArea** (Above Grade Living Area) - ↑ Positive impact (r=0.71)

### Key EDA Findings

- **Log Transformation**: SalePrice right-skewed (skewness=1.88) → near-normal after log1p (skewness=0.12)
- **Missing Data**: PoolQC 99.5%, MiscFeature 96.3%, Alley 93.8% missing - strategically filled with "None"
- **Strong Correlations**: TotalSF (0.833), OverallQual (0.79), GrLivArea (0.71) highest predictive features
- **Outlier Removal**: 2 extreme outliers removed (GrLivArea > 4000 AND SalePrice < $300k)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

**Data Processing:**
- Pandas, NumPy

**Visualization:**
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Machine Learning:**
- Scikit-learn (Ridge, RandomForest, GradientBoosting)
- Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, SimpleImputer, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder

**Model Explainability:**
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

**Development Environment:**
- Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## 🎓 Important Concepts

### Log Transformation
- **Why?** Kaggle metric uses RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error)
- **How?** Model with `y = log1p(SalePrice)`, convert back with `expm1()`
- **Result:** Right-skewed distribution → Near-normal distribution

### Feature Engineering Examples

```python
# Total Square Footage
TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF

# Age of House
HouseAge = YrSold - YearBuilt

# Renovation Age
RemodAge = YrSold - YearRemodAdd

# Total Bathrooms
TotalBathrooms = FullBath + 0.5*HalfBath + BsmtFullBath + 0.5*BsmtHalfBath

# Total Porch Area
TotalPorchSF = OpenPorchSF + EnclosedPorch + ScreenPorch
```

### Pipeline Structure

```python
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('num', Pipeline([
        ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
        ('scaler', StandardScaler())
    ]), numeric_features),
    ('cat', Pipeline([
        ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
        ('encoder', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False))
    ]), categorical_features)
])

model = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('regressor', Ridge(alpha=10.0))
])
```

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | `pip install --break-system-packages <package-name>` |
| `FileNotFoundError` | Check directory with `pwd`, ensure you're in the correct folder |
| `NameError` | Restart kernel, run cells sequentially |
| Graphics not showing | Run in notebook interface (VS Code/Jupyter) instead of terminal |
| SHAP calculation slow | Expected for large datasets; wait or reduce sample size |

## 📝 Deliverables

## 🔍 Error Analysis Insights

The model struggles with very large houses (>4,000 sq ft):
- **House 1** (Crawfor, 2,752 sq ft): Under-predicted by $62,734 (20.1%)
- **House 2** (CollgCr, 4,056 sq ft): Over-predicted by $55,272 (20.0%)
- **House 3** (NAmes, 4,446 sq ft): Over-predicted by $52,373 (21.5%)

**Root Cause:** Linear models struggle with non-linear pricing in premium neighborhoods and very large houses.

## 📊 Test Data Predictions

- **Number of predictions:** 1,459 houses
- **Price range:** $45,903 - $1,755,851
- **Mean prediction:** $179,602
- **Median prediction:** $156,632
- **All quality checks:** ✅ Passed
